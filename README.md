### ðŸš€ Project Description 
Transformers are state-of-the-art (SOTA) model architectures, with models like GPT, BERT, T5, XLNet, and RoBERTa excelling in natural language processing tasks such as understanding, generation, and translation.

#### An Image is Worth 16x16 Words 

Despite their success in NLP, the use of Transformers in computer vision (CV) is still emerging. This project aims to explore the Transformer architecture for CV applications:

1. **Introduction to Deep Learning Models** :
   - Basics of naive deep-learning models.

2. **Sequential Data Processing** :
   - Using RNNs and LSTMs.

3. **Vision Transformers** :
   - Understanding and implementation.

4. **Image Captioning Model** :
   - Generating descriptive captions for images.
